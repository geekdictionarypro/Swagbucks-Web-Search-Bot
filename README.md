Since the program should have a certificate that does not immediately mark the program for removal, there should be no issues with your anti-virus tampering with the program. However, in the case that your AV program detects malware or a false positive of the program, make sure to mark the file as safe or other means. Additionally, you can also fill out appropriate forms on your respective AV company's website to submit the application as a false positive to help update the AV company's virus definitions.
